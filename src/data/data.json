                    "The first chapter of The Outer Limits explores the different theories behind the strangest celestial object in the universe: the black hole. Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.",
                    "Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\""
